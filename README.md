# Sky-shield
The "Sky Shield" project is a real-time object detection system in Python. It uses the YOLOv8 deep learning model with OpenCV to process live video streams. The system is designed for surveillance, providing high-accuracy, low-latency identification of objects and demonstrating strong performance in both FPS and mAP metrics.
